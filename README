This is the Pleft software that runs on www.pleft.com.
Documentation is limited right now, but please email sander.dijkhuis@gmail.com
for more details and to get involved.

System requirements:
- Django 1.2 or higher
- a Java runtime environment (for plovr)
- SQLite2 for Python (for local testing)

Installation:
1. mkdir external
2. Download the most recent plovr build to the external/ dir, from:
   http://code.google.com/p/plovr/downloads/list
3. Symlink external/plovr-[code].jar to external/plovr.jar
4. Create pleft/local_settings.py, based on one of the examples in that dir.
   If you just want to test Pleft, use pleft/local_settings.py.debug and
   modify the paths (especially DATABASE_NAME and MEDIA_ROOT).
   The SQLite database will be created automatically.
5. python pleft/manage.py syncdb

Run debug servers:
python pleft/manage.py runplovr
python pleft/manage.py runserver

There may be a lot of JavaScript warnings that still need to be fixed.
If you don't want to see them, modify the .json files in plapp/js to set
"level": "QUIET" and restart the 'runplovr' command.

In debug mode, emails are written to the console instead of being sent.
If you need a link that was provided this way, note that characters like
the = are escaped. So you might for example need to replace =3D with =.

If you want to test or deploy translations, install gettext and run:
python pleft/manage.py mo

If you want to deploy Pleft, compile the JavaScript files to .cjs using:
mkdir static/scripts
python pleft/manage.py compile

Note:
- If you are using MySQL, make sure that the database is created using:
    CREATE DATABASE name CHARACTER SET utf8
  Also, for the user system to work, the email address field must be made
  case sensitive, using:
    ALTER TABLE plauth_user MODIFY email VARCHAR(255) COLLATE utf8_bin
